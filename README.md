## Getting Started
Hi there! This project took me longer than expected but it was worth the grind!  

## To get started
1.) Pull the repo  
2.) On the root directory of the project run the two following commands on seperate terminal:   
    - ```npm run soheil-backend```   
    - ```npm run soheil-frontend```   
3.) see the magic on the browser (you can also see what it should look like over here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_MaK7l1BOo&ab_channel=NathanTablang])


## Possible issues  
- You might run over some python installation issues... Of all the things that I did, simply deplying the app as a web app so you can see it with no hassle took me two days. Eventually I just gave up and decided I'll just hand over the code with a getting started guide. For some reason there's something going on with my dependencies: [cv2 (which is opencv-python when installed), scipy, scikit-image, numpy, and/or Pillow]
    - Depending on what issue you might have when you run ```npm run soheil-backend``` you might have to run ```npm uninstall -y <dependency_name>``` (type w/o the brackets) then install it back again with ```npm install <dependency_name>``` (type w/o the brackets)
- I really would like to make sure that this thing works as meshing in python with my javascript is the only thing that's rocky. If ever there's a circumstance that I would need to resolve, feel free to contact me at 301-377-3076. I also live in the UMD campus, brief mins away from IRB.
